# Proef Examen Repo

In deze repository vind je de informatie over het examen project.

Omschrijf de examenopdracht evt de klant en wat het doel voor de klant is. Omschrijf ook beknopt wat het idee van je game is. Een complete en uitgebreide beschrijving komt in het functioneel ontwerp (onderdeel van de wiki)

Voor de examen opdracht moest er een game gemaakt worden die Augmented Reality gameplay elementen integreren in een wandelroute. De klant (Berbas) is een Bed & breakfast gelegen in de Veluwe, om de wandeling voor kinderen dragelijker te maken. Voor de game hebben we gekozen voor een concept waarbij we de gps locatie gebruiken

Wave System by Student X
Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line.
